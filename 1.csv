"They're quality. They're affordable. They're durable. They clean up messes like nobody's business. What more is there to love??

I use these for my small business and they are fantastic. They wash up super well and they're such an amazing size for all types of cleaning. If you're looking for a good microfiber rag but don't want to pay prices for some of the other brands out there- give these a shot! I promise - you won't be disappointed."
"Wish these had no tags but the price and quanity, and quality of these is very good. I get about a year from a box and they are invaluable for lots of cleaning tasks."
"it's literally cheap microfiber cloths and not sure why you are reading this. for a 144 pack, how much quality do you expect? it's super cheap and works decent enough - it's not a Chemical Guys wooly mammoth but it does the job and allows you to chuck the super dirty ones. If you REALLY care about your paint, I doubt you'd be purchasing this anyways. these are great for just using around the house or to just do a quick and dirty job."
"I purchased 144 of these and my spouse and I were able to stop using paper towels. This is how I made it work in our small kitchen. The space that would have been used for a paper towel holder is used instead for a more useful kitchen machine, a sodastream, on our counter. I estimate the time to maintain this microfiber towel system I have designed/developed/invented is equal to the amount of time my spouse and I would have spent getting and re-getting paper towels, storing them, placing them on the rolls, tearing them off, etc. Since our kitchen is small and we do not have a seperate room for a pantry, I decided to place our pantry, neatly, in an aesthetically pleasing way, throughout our small home. In this instance it was best to clear some cabinet space across from our sink. On one shelf we store our clean microfiber cloths. On another I repurposed a large plastic zippered bag with a cloth handle I got along with a comforter I purchased on Amazon. In it I placed an unplugged, uncapped Glade plugin Air Freshener which then works as a diffuser. The microfiber cloths that are used as paper towels to pick up crumbs (note most counter and oven straightening can best be accomplished with a Dyson Animal DC-44 with the crevice attachment on high,) I place in the homemade repurposed hamper (plastic zippered comforter bag with the air freshener) in another shelf in a closed cabinet. Any that are wet, or used to wipe up (can be sprayed with environmentally friendly all purpose Watkins cleaner sprayed on them) are placed by my spouse and I to dry on one of three coat trees we have. We have 2 metal ones in the bathroom we use for towels and clothes and one in the den we use for coats and these wet microfiber towels while they are drying. Then each time one of us goes to wash towels we throw the microfiber cloths in with them. The two of us never run out, nor worry if we forget to throw all the soiled ones in with a load of towels since we purchased 144 of them. Therefore I recommend if you implement this for yourself to accumulate/purchase144 of your own for 2 or 1 person, double that amount for 3 or 4 people before you do away with the paper towels. In the meanwhile buy recycled if at all possible. We also found out it was more ergonomic to get a very light trash receptacle in our kitchen that we can move about effortlessly to position near where we shake the crumbs off the towel or lift it up and wipe the crumbs right into it. Note the crevice tool of the Dyson DC Animal 44 is dishwasher safe-we wash it on the top rack. Watch out as some of the attachments have electrical connections in them and should not go in the dishwasher. The brush attachments are great for oven cleaning. I hate cleaning and so does my spouse but we love our home and so we have figured out easy, painless ways to keep it clean by thinking outside the box.
UPDATE: THANKS SO MUCH I was able to purchase more of these GREAT Microfiber Cloths-I and my spouse suffered a disaster caused by severe weather a few years ago and most of our microfiber cloths had tears, rips and huge holes in them as a result. We waited several years to see if we could repair them but have been inundated. Finally I was able to fit it in to my household partition to purchase more-I even use them as tissues, paper towels, to wash our two cars, etc., etc., so I am greatly relieved to have more of them sans holes, rips, etc. to use. Thanks Amazon folks-"
Wonderful
"We use these all the time at our manufacturing facility for cleaning glass/metal packaging. They're great and don't leave behind any lint. They are pretty thin and the absorbency isn't that good, but if you're using them for wiping down stuff versus cleaning up and absorbing messes, they're a great value."
"We use these daily on our dairy farm. They also get washed daily and after a few years, they are still holding strong! They absorb all the dirt and sand from the cows and moisture when we need it. They are used to wipe off iodine dip and get washed in bleach and have held up nicely! We also use them in our kitchen and ice cream truck where we use heavy duty soap and sanitize and they hold up well. The cloth is thicker than a normal towel. We have bought multiple cases"
I have been satisfied with my order for one year and I recommend it to everyone. The best assistant in the house
"I will not complain about the size since that is as advertised. I will, however, address other areas and quality issues.

Intended Use: I bought these primarily for car cleaning because my husband is meticulous about automotive detailing. I also do not use paper towels in the kitchen/home, so these will do cleaning duty, too.

Cons:
1) Each cloth is tagged with a large paper-like care label. For my husband, this is unacceptable because it's too scratchy and I'm inclinded to agree. So here we are, ripping off all of these labels.

2) They smell and feel weird. The care instructions say to wash with cool water before using. Normally (and with every other microfiber I've purchased) i would laugh this off. The smell and coating on them, however, was weird enough that i DID was them before using! And that only made the smell worse! And I'm not even a freak about ""chemicals!"" I actually compared them to some unused clothes I got from the home improvement store and they are substantially more coated, almost to the point of being tacky to the touch.

3) They are not good quality and I give them a year or less in the rotation before they are thrown away. This sounds okay, but considering we have good quality microfiber clothes that are now a decade old, it's a little wasteful. I was thinking the 144-count would last me YEARS.

Pros:
1) You get what you pay for. The bulk pricing is as cheap as I've seen, especially with subscribe and save. If you view these as fairly disposable, then you will not be disappointed.

Overall, I don't feel good about this purchase and will not buy again. I don't use paper products in the home because they're wasteful and expensive. Sadly, I think these are pretty wasteful too and they smell so weird, I wonder what part of the world they're poisoning with their production. Still, I'll make the best of it and use these for heavy cleaning. You do get what you pay when it comes to these things. High quality clothes make a huge difference. But if you cannot properly care for the high quality ones or you're using these with heavy solvents or soil, these make sense."
"These microfiber are good for one time auto exterior paint use. You must remove tag! I don’t know why they put tags on these. Then use on vehicle during paint correction, once dirty either throw away or wash only with other micro fibers and DO NOT dry! Use very little soap also, use sanitary mode on washer if you have it.

Throw away any that have any contaminates on them like saw dust etc. or they can be used for interior detailing or cleaning inside the house. If done right sometime you can get a couple uses out of them on paint. Be very careful, it’s easy to scratch car with dirty rag."
"I bought the largest option you can get. I think it was 144 of them. Split it with my daughter. They are a good size and super absorbent! When compared to Norwex, I have to say I like these better. I feel these absorb better and I like the size. Although I wish they had a variety of sizes cause a smaller one would be nice also. I also don’t lose my mind if my kid decided they want to wipe the cooktop when it’s hot and melts it. At the price I paid, if I lost one here and there, no big deal. If I lost one here and there of my NORWEX....well I’ll have someone’s head for that. They cost 30-40x as much! So now i can relax and be happy!"
"Bought these to clean my tanning bed. They are quite soft, get the job done perfectly, never leave any cleaning solution behind. They are perfect for wiping down. I don't know how they would hold up for scrubbing. I would purchase again."
"Are these the best Microfiber towels on the market, definitely not. But when you buy them in bulk like this, they are around 35¢ apiece. The good thing about the microfiber is that they have the ability to grab and hold onto small particles of dirt. The bad thing is that they fairly quickly load up with dirt and start leaving tiny scratches on paint and plexiglass. At 35¢ you can just grab a new one.

If you spend $4 or $5 on nicer towels, they will still get dirty and abrasive just a quickly, but you will be tempted to continue using it because you don't have a large box of new ones just waiting."
"I bought the 24 pack about 5 years ago. After much use in a variety of ways from heavy duty to light cleaning in the bathroom, kitchen, the garage, anywhere else indoor and outside, I was running on a few good usable microfiber towels. Now I went and got the 144 pack, filled a whole shelf, and I think I'll be good for a couple of decades."
I bought to replace most of the paper towels used daily. Better for environment and a big cost savings.
About the mega load pack. Have a lifetime supply of these now! They get the job done. What else to say. Best value for the money I could find out there. What hand's down by this again.
"these are great for the price, we use them in our detail department, when new, to wipe down and wax cars without scratching even fresh paint, after that I bring them home and wash them and reuse them for general detailing and cleaning,they will last about three washes then they start getting a little worn,but at this price and auto delivery I Love them .better then paper towels for sure"
"I cannot see any way to go wrong with these. Use for everything, and with this wonderful quantity @ great value.... Almost 'inspires' me to clean - haha - but for those who are already inspired - have even more fun using them!"
"We use these for home and also for our residential cleaning company. They work great and it’s nice they come in multiple colors. Also haven’t seen them fading much, even the white which I was surprised about. Good value for the money!"
"These towels work great and are a great value. I use them for cleaning around the house, cleaning my car, and cleaning my bike. Great all-purpose towels. The nice thing is that the tag can be torn off easily, which you should do with each one so that you don't scratch it on your car's paint."
"Decent quality microfiber cloths. I have purchased many different brands of microfiber cloths and I think these are a great deal. They are fairly thick and durable and clean very well. Some of the other brands were thinner and did not last nearly as long. Also when detail a car in the hot sun the heat didn't go right through these like some of the other brands.

These were purchased to detail golf carts and cars."
"This is a phenomenal deal. At this price, you cannot go wrong. These cloths are great for everything. I originally purchased them to wash and detail the motorcycles at our shop. I have since bought more for home use. Dusting, polishing, soaking up spills, I've even used them as shop rags. They are durable, and do not tend to ""shed"" as I've found other inexpensive microfibers to do.

Highly Recommended"
"For what you get with the little you spend, these cloths are great. And they work just as they should as well. I used them to clean my paintball lens (which can get pretty dirty and smudgy with all the paint that goes on it through the day). I used one cloth for the whole day and it worked perfect. I couldn't ask for more. My cat loves laying on the stack of them as well."
"I use these in the house a few times, then ""retire"" them to the dairy, where they're perfect for washing before milking. I buy the big box on subscribe & save. My son wants to get some for his Navy quarters. I guess they made an impression on him!"
The must buy cheap (but not cheap) detail microfiber. This is the perfect starter towel. Yes it's not as good as other more expensive towels (duh what do you expect) but for learning proper use and technique these are perfect
They are on the thinner side but for the most part work well enough for the various cleanup jobs we have. I use them when cleaning my bike chain and applying liquid wax on my vehicles. We grab one whenever we need to handle cleanup activities outdoors around the house.
"I don't know what you can really say about a microfiber cloth. These may be a little thinner than some other more expensive cloths, but they work like a charm. My wife and I use them every day for something and they are holding up very well. We have washed some of them several times and they are still going strong. For the money, I think they are a great purchase."
"Soft and durable, absorbs easily.
Used for detailing cars"
"Very nice quality, they wash well too. I have a car detailing business and those work great, I presoak them then wash them in the washer on hot, heavy duty, and then in the dryer on low, delicate, they come out nice. Once you take off the label/tag these towels wont leave any streaks on a car."
"Received 144 cloths. They are a little thinner than other brands, but do the job just fine. Very soft, the yellow color runs onto the white if you wash them together however. Just make sure to wash the yellow separately if you care about keeping the colors true. I don't really mind since they are used for cleaning."
These are great for cleaning. The can be used in the kitchen as well as the bathroom. I put on on the bottom of the swiffer for dry sweeping and then another one for wet cleaning. one cloth can be used as four swiffer clothes. just remove the hair before wash for a better wash. Wash and reuse Do not put in dryer.
For the money these are my favorite cleaning cloths. Would buy them again in a heartbeat. Are much better than the old amazon basics microfiber cloths I got a few years ago.
"If you're just going to use these for drying dishes other light interior housework, they're probably fine. I use microfiber cloths regularly to help dry my car after a wash, and these are by far the flimsiest, most unimpressive cloths I've ever worked with. They're very thin and light so their water absorption potential is low. I can see these things getting thrashed easily with repeated use. I've moved on to other, thicker, more heavy-duty brands of microfiber clothes."
I would have given the towels five stars except for the lint. Don't bother using them right out of the box. They aren't even close to being lint free. Put them through the washing machine first. After that they work great and are cheap!
These are the best towels / rags our business has ever used. Their super absorbent and can be washed and reused. We love em.
Good
"Wow! That was a lot of cloths. I bought the big pack and in hindsight, I realize that 144 is way more than I really excepted. They work nicely and at this price if I kill a few, no problem. Must don't"
Es de buena calidad y cumplió con la expectativa
"Very nice soft cleaning clothes that I use for everyday use. I originally bought them for cheap ""spit rags"" for my baby daughter and they work well for that. My only complaint about these clothes is that they kind of stick to your hands if you have rougher hands, no big deal though 5 Stars"
"Soft, durable, and well made cleaning clothes. I bought over 144 of these and would buy again. Great quality and value for the money spent."
Nice cleaning cloths at a price that you don't mind using them for the dirtiest of jobs. We bought these to support or move. Almost as cheap as packing paper / foam for wrapping glasses and they have become extremely handy for cleaning up dust and other things (in both houses).
"Excellent. I order these exclusively. Great value and service.
I use for kitchen towels cleaning ipad, iphone screens, windows, ect."
This was one of my very first Amazon purchases and it may be the best thing I've EVER bought online! Shared them with my daughter as she started out on her own and we're both thrilled with how well these wash up.
Always need cleaning rags
"I really like the price and size of these. I would have preferred different colors, but guess I cannot complain too much. I traded aesthetics for economy I have reduced my paper towel consumption by probably 80-85%! So far they are holding up well after six weeks or so of use."
started with 48 then 2 more 48's then the 148 and then tried another brand just as nice both brands are the best for my cleaning service and they dry so fast and pick up hair and sand in my resort town I live and work you need these.
Great quality; nice colors and finally affordable microfiber cloths!! I have been saving so much money since I purchased these cloths - no more paper towels for cleaning. I've used them for cleaning my entire house; my car and cleaning my car seats and car kick mats too! Love them!
"Talk about a lot of microfiber towels! My boyfriend just shook his head at me when I opened the box. I'm transitioning to using less paper products (like paper towels, disposable diapers, etc) so I bought this to replace paper towels and napkins. Love them!"
"New version of this product is terrible. Old version was amazing.

They are scratchy and not as soft.

Also don't wash clean."
I use these to wipe clean my truck after washing it each time. They do not leave your vehicle with swirl marks like other towels do. Just a really durable towel to use anywhere in the garage. Besides just wash them and use again.
Really work and great value compared to many other microfiber cleaning cloths (that also work great). I can clean many things with water that I previously used cleaning solutions on (even that green mildew off the outside of the house).
"The density of the microfiber loops on the surface is really low compared to the Microfiber towels I get at Costco (for about the same price.) But I don't have a Costco membership anymore and Amazon delivers. Not sure how well they will hold up. Anyway, I feel I got what I paid for."
"I manage a commercial cleaning company and we use these every day. They work great for cleaning windows, and wiping down every other surface imaginable without leaving lint behind. They wash well and hold up to a lot of abuse."
"I like how the towels come in 3 different colors. We use one color for cleaning, one color for baby feeding messes, and the last color for cleaning up in the garage. These work best after they have been washed."
Amazon has doubled the price of the 144 count and because they dont hold up well with washing they are just not worth it anymore
The large box has lasted me so long and they are really good microfiber rags.
"These are amazing, but shrink a little bit and don't come as clean as they ship. That is to be expected. 10/10 would by again."
Ordered a ton of these years ago. Holding up very well. I use them as Swiffer pads and then wash them. Works well for dust and light mopping.
"If you buy microfibers from Costco or say Autozone, STOP! These are the way to go. They are priced right and they are great quality. I will be buying these every time as my replacements."
Best thing I ever did was to order these. I only wash these once a week and have enough wash clothes to use throughout the week for messes.
"These microfiber cloths are extremely thin. Compared to my vibrawipe clothes they seem like a joke.
They are much cheaper though."
Wish all white or blue but a great deal. Very nice quality!
"I was skeptical because of the price but these are really great quality. I plan to cut up old flannel baby blankets and sew these on the back to make reusable ""unpaper"" towels."
"Might be too many cloths, but the price was fantastic, so I gave some away. So far so good and no complaints from anyone that I handed them out to."
Gentle but firm enough to clean with.
"For everyday use in my vinyl business, these work very well and are a good value."
Muy buena elección de compra
"I'd really love these towels if they didn't have the stupid tag on them. Also, curiously, a lot of them are already dirty when they arrive, despite being sealed."
Inexpensive and perfect for what I bought them for.
Good deal for the money but a bit thinner then most I've bought. Not really a problem when cleaning. I'd buy this again.
It does it’s job the mid range quality I was say more to use of this for the ladies kitchen
Great towel for cleaning but little small
I use these like paper towels in the garage! A bit too course to use on paint but for general cleaning they work well.
deal
awesome product and price. Can't find these at this price anywhere else and they are quality cloth. THANKS!
Good for light cleaning but not for pick up lot of water.I will buy again
Good quality
We go through a lot of these good value
What a deal nice cloths perfert for Coins and Other colletables that need gentel cleaning. I use the cloths for many many things
NO HERA LAS MEDIDAS QUE ESPERABA PERO SON MUY BUENAS
"I use these to detail cars and love the heap price but great quality. If you love your cars, I highly recommend."
Great product and overall experience!
These are great and much cheaper then stor prices. Highly recommend
"Great value, a million uses. This is a lifetime supply, so I took most to work where they are used for celaning/polishing."
"Great cloth very lovely, good use to my home every where, excellent!"
Cleans everything from eyeglasses to kitchen counters; SO handy and useful!!!
Great product!
"Quantity and value, it's all here"
Just as described purchased couple times
Great value for so many towels.
"My favorite cleaning cloths, period. The microfiber is awesome at attracting dust and cleaning almost any surface. Use it with alcohol and it becomes magical."
very soft as expected
Good quality
"A little small and pretty light weight. I would give it three and a half stars if I could. Not terrible, but not great either."
One and done! Don't buy for quality! They curl and shed. They work really well for my first use and then become cleaning/grease rags
These work great for the price!!
I'm loving it great quality
good cloths
"Nice size, nice thickness, look as good as 3M microfiber towels."
"Not as ""plush"" as those from Sam's or Costco. As described, smaller in size than those from Sam's or Costco. Can I say ""thinner"", ""not as thick""? Probably not buying again."
