Terry Eckman,"This superior mobile device offers significant enhancements over previous iterations. Its high-capacity battery enables extended usage, complemented by rapid charging capabilities even faster if you have a 45W charger. Preliminary assessments indicate highly favorable performance. Acquisition of this device is strongly advised. The phone's robust design incorporates a metal frame, a departure from prior models, while maintaining an ergonomic profile. Its dimensions are comparable to the S23 Ultra, although featuring more rounded edges. Considering its size, storage capacity, operating system, battery life, and photographic capabilities, it presents exceptional value. This device is highly recommended."
M. Monroe,"This phone is amazing. I upgraded from an already top-of-the-line S23 to the S25+ and I can already see the difference. Super smooth scrolling, blazingly fast app loading. Excellent camera. Generous storage. Lots of customizability."
Phred,"This was a major upgrade for us, we went from a S9 to this S25. It is amazing how fast it is and how much better it looks.

We are still getting use to them, yet we love them.

My husband got the S25 with the 256 memory I think it is and I got the S25 Ultra with the I think 512 memory.

He didn't want a phone much bigger than his old S9 and I wanted a phone bigger than the S9.

Mine isn't huge yet it definitely makes the regular one look smaller when I use his.

They look sleek and very nice!!

They are fast and I don't have any issues with lag or anything like that."
LeisaW,"I am an older person (65) and for yrs went to a phone store so I could have data transferred from my old phone to my new phone; and of course paying premium $$$ for the phone and the service. NOT anymore!! I bought this new Samsung and upon charging it literally walked me through Step-by-Step on how to transfer my phone data, contacts, apps, etc...and keeping my phone number. I also received $200.00 from Amazon!! So getting the best phone on the market at a great deal!! I am not tech savvy AT ALL, so was so proud that I took this small leap of faith to do it myself (it was one of the easiest tech things I have ever done) and saved several hundred dollars by doing so!! Love this phone! The Camera takes excellent pictures and videos and the features are great! Love also that I got back $200.00 Amazon gift card!!"
L. S. Brodsky,"I upgraded from a S22 and this phone has many more bells and whistles, especially as it relates to AI and effortless completion of tasks. The data transfer goes very smoothly and the phone leads you through the steps easily. But here is what they do not tell you: the data transfer does not transfer anything you have paired and it does not transfer logons and passwords for all of the Apps transferred. There is still a massive amount of work to do to get to the smooth operation of your previous phone. Battery life is definitely better with this phone. I am pleased with the purchase."
Mar,"I love this device, but I have a suggestion for the professional camera. Please consider a camera update that allows for full manual adjustments, utilizing all the capabilities of the hardware. Currently, there are limits in place. For example, in astrophotos using the raw camera, the ISO can only be manually adjusted up to 3200, while AI allows it to go up to 8000. Although editing is possible afterward, I would prefer to set the camera for an optimal professional photo according to my preferences and the hardware's capabilities. Offering both options—AI & auto, and a fully manual mode without limits—would be fantastic. If anyone has been able to make all adjustments manually, please share your experience."
Michael Ashe,"I upgraded from an S21, and dang this phone is nice! Better camera, better speakers, sharper screen. It's very, very snappy. But the S21 was fast too. I only have one gripe, and once Samsung fixes it I'll come back and change my review to five stars... It's no longer possible to have a 4x5 grid pattern on the home screens. The only options now are 4x6 or 5x6. I read in one forum that eventually it will be possible? I'm hoping that's the case. I thought the phone was going to be better in every regard but this particular limitation is a step down for me. Anyway great phone overall!
Update: I've been using this phone for 5 days now and screw it, I'm moving my review to five stars even though I still can't do the 4x5 grid. This phone is amazing.
2nd update: Not really an update, just that I forgot to mention how easy it is to transition from one Samsung to another. Literally all my apps on the other phone were downloaded to the new phone, it was so freaking easy to make the transition."
EZ,"Good - beautiful screen. Blazing fast. Amazing camera. Looks great. Same as the 21,22,23,24

Bad - palm rejection is terrible. There’s no way to use the phone case less. And movement registered by the palm, caused the phone to cancel out your actual taps. So like Steve said a decade ago…”you’re holding it wrong” or it just sucks.

Screen is vivid… but as always blow out many of the photos and videos you view on screen….something to keep in mind as your photos will look differently on a computer or on an iPhone.

Most annoying - WiFi drops suddenly or when not in use for a bit. Usually it’ll reconnect in a second on my iPhone…takes over a minute on the s25. Very annoying when low cell coverage.

And worst of all…why buy at this price if next week Amazon will discount this for 100 dollars ? Not going to get hit with the lower price 31 days later…"
Jeremy,"When i saw the launch of this phone I was pretty underwhelmed.......however i still ordered the phone and i am pretty satisfied with it.

This phone is very comfortable to hold without a case on it. The curved edges make a big difference.
As for the look of the phone - i like it. Many like the boxy look of the 24 ultra but i don't have any issues.

So far my only complaint is the removal of Bluetooth for s pen and software update.
It is an utterly poor excuse from Samsung for removing that feature even though they claim less than 1 percent uses it.
Just because i do not use my spare tire on my car regularly does not mean i do not want it on my vehicle. When i do need it i am happy that its there when i need it. Sammy should fix this ASAP

As for software......it is February and the phone is still on December patch.....

Overall though....great device"
Zev,"I bought 2 of these for my wife and I, and we love it. Photos look great, and I am constantly finding new and cool features supported by the phone. The AI tools are really useful and fun. Granted it sometimes needs you to reword it, but it is surprisingly useful especially with photos. We have had these for a few weeks and I would definitely recommend these."
Movie lover from HB,"I like this new phone overall, BUT THIS PHONE does NOT PLAY M4A MUSIC using SAMSUNG's OWN MUSIC PLAYER, even though it says it DOES! LOTS OF PEOPLE MENTIONED PROBLEM ONLINE and it is still not fixed by Samsung.

I have hundred+ M4A songs on my phone that play perfectly fine on my desktop Music Player, so I really do not want to convert them all to M3. After hours of searching, looks like only option is to download a DIFFERENT MUSIC PLAYER. That is ridiculous and very annoying."
Joshebeth Ortega,"This was love at first sight, the design is very nice. The weight compared to the S22 Ultra does not feel much difference, however in image quality and functions takes light years to that model.

Since day 1 I have enjoyed it very much. The only thing I notice to date is that certain touch functions are stuck in certain applications such as Instagram or I do not know if the app is the problem itself.

I'm looking forward to see what else it brings in features to get the most out of it."
Adrienne,I bought the S25 ultra to replace my daughter's S22 ultra phone that I also got from amazon. She said the phone is good and functional as it should be. She has no bad comments to say about the phone . I was alittle worried since the phone box came open. I will be getting her S22 ultra phone which still works good.
Grumpa,"I switched from a Galaxy S20+ to this. I wasn't going to do that, but my phone got the vertical stripe, and I didn't want to invest more into it, so...
All these years I have lamented the quality of my photos from the S20+. Sure, with a casual glance, they're fine. But zooming in, or telephoto shots, and the pixelation is so bad.
I've pick this phone (25 Ultra) with the hope of far better pics. I'm still checking that out, but what I like right off the bat, is the ""Remaster"". This AI rework on my past photos is great (not perfect, of course, but sure helps in some instances).
I'm trying out the AI voice interaction, and it's growing on me a little. Probably not worth the cost to buy, but I picked this hopefully to have better pics.
Added 3/3/25: I've been taking pictures and finding that this Ultra does a much better job. See photos: the first is normal (wide-angle 23mm), the 2nd is 10x telephoto. Much better than my old S20+."
Kierra,"So far so good, the only complaint I have so far is my fault for not reading there was no slot for SD card."
Tsega Yohannes,"The box states that it includes USB-C to USB C-cable, quick start guide but it has only the phone"
Adam B.,"Coming from a OnePlus 5, the difference in UI is very much noticable. I despise the fact I can't remove or otherwise disable some of the default apps in favor of using my own selection, but I guess that is to be expected with anything other than OnePlus - at least in my humble option. The phone is big, as clearly indicated in the description, and can be difficult to handle without a decent case."
Zac,"Arrived in perfect condition. Feels very premium and I like the screen. S-Pen not having bluetooth sucks, but I didn't use the features all that much, but it will suck not to have them."
R. Heikes,"Got it for my wife. It was a big upgrade from her Note 10 Lol. It is just awesome. Super fast and all the bells and whistles! And the best camera by far!

Thank you Samsung !"
Daniel I.,My wife is picky about her phones being small. This time around she decided to keep it because of all the new features that she likes compared to her VERY OLD S9. The charging and battery life are still not as good as my Pixel 8a and we haven't compared the rest of the features yet...
inspired4sure,"This phone is awesome, not sure if it's worth it's price in awesome but amazing none the less."
Cristian flores,El equipo esta excelente me encantó
Jackson,"Excelente teléfono es una bestia, saca unas fotos espectacular, y la IA lo mejor de lo mejor te ayuda en múltiples funciones"
Aramazd,"No problems were noticed whatsoever. The only drawback is that the call recording includes a sound notification that states, ""This call is being recorded"", which informs the other party in the conversation about the recording taking place. But I suppose this is due to US legislation. Maybe the ones produced for the Latin American market do not have this drawback."
no,"The phone is very nice but it gets hot. I will never order a bundle from Amazon again. The pre-order bundle was supposed to include a ""$200 Amazon gift card on us""... Meaning Amazon gives you a free $200 gift card. But they charged my credit card $200 instead for the gift card. I've talked to Anmazon multiple times to get this worked out."
Fonny wong,"I need a new phone , buy in amazon very good price and deal.
Highly recommend."
Angel L.,"Excelente terminal muy buena autonomía, mejor panel, las cámaras cumplen a la perfección, me hubiese gustado que mejorarán el tele de 3 aumentos, por lo demás excelente, aprecio al disminución del peso y del grosor, y one yi 7 excelente"
Mateo,"I moved from an iPhone 11 Pro Max to this phone, so it's a big step up for me. I love it, considering it's my first Android phone. I think the 200-megapixel camera and fast processor are its best qualities. Gemini feels natural and helps a lot, to be honest. (Not as smart as ChatGPT though, at least for now)"
Cappuccino Billy,Bought this phone for my wife. She likes it. Excellent product works as advertised. No complaints so far used it for about a week now. She only had problems transferring my data from my old android phone. You will need to order a case and phone charger. For the price it should of came with these items.
Clint C,"Fantastic phone! This was an upgrade for my wife, I have the S23 ultra and love it. Her old S9 was overdue. I'm jealous! But not enough to get another one. All the S2n Ultras are great phones so I will wait for the S30 Ultimate!"
Seth Humphreys,"Bought the newest 25plus as an upgrade for my dad, I do recommend the plus or the ultra to anyone in need of an upgrade. 6.7in display, good battery size and if treated well it will last a long while."
Mauricio Torrez,"Lo mejor que he obtenido, me funciona de maravilla"
Francis W Howell,"I love this phone, it's one of the best phone I've ever had. The price was very cheap."
Spenda Buck,"Wow, this phone is so great, it's hard to put into words! I watched a few YT videos about how to set up special features and customize it and I am wow'ed! One of the cool features is the lock screen. I put a picture from out my window on it and set it so that it coordinates with the time of day (darkness/sunny) and the weather. It's dark durning dark hours and bright when it's sunny out. If it's foggy out, it has fog rolling across the picture. If it's raining, it shows rain on the picture and it shows snow too. That's just one of the many cool features."
LeeAndre,Best thing i could've ever bought.
Dixie E. Sansom,"This does not get a five star because it came with the wrong cord. We used the cord from the old S10 and it worked. If the company that shipped this could send us the right cord, it would be appreciated."
Alexis Bruce,"I'm still getting used to it. But it's highly efficient, has added interactive features with my cars hands free system. Great camera. When syncing with my old phone it transferred my data, apps. Pics, in seconds. All had to do was transfer my SIM card from my old phone to this one and I was 100% functioning. No need to call my career and go through the hassle of transferring phones."

Los zapatos.fueron recibidos en Nicaragua. Vino en No. 8 y lo pedimos en 7. Pueden verificar el pedido. No le quedó al destinatario,Exactamente lo que esperaba a un buen precio
RoyJoe,"if you are a IPhone user this is the best phone to switch to, UI 7 is just like the iPhone UI and is better in every way, Customizable to your preferences. As a samsung user upgraded from the Samsung S21, this is a massive step up and I suggest my fellow Samsung users to entertain the idea of getting the S25 any model"
Pedro Lasaballett,"Excelente dispositivo, un tamaño cómodo como ya pocos hacen, muy bueno y rápido"
Smiley,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!! 😍😍😍
Great upgrade from my flip 4 (it's still a good phone though:) )

Suzette,Love it!
Amazon Customer,Excelente
Hoodhu,Loved it
Alejandro,10/10
Stew,Great phone-easy move data and files from my old Samsung phone. Shipped with no SIM card as you call your provider to get a virtual SIM card.
Sassy,"Always buy the Galaxy phones, love them. User friendly!"
T. Lee,"Love the hardware. It's probably the most complete smartphone package in this form factor in early 2025.

The software is another story. First of all, it comes with a good bit of crapware installed. A handful of Microsoft apps are there (which you can thankfully permanently remove). There's a ton of Samsung apps which you can unfortunately not remove. I don't need nor want Samsungs Browser, or their health apps, or most of the other Samsung branded apps that come preloaded on this phone that you can't remove.

One UI 7 isn't terrible, but you'll probably be better served by another launcher. At least you can switch that.

Overall, I think the Pixel 9 series phones offer a more cohesive software experience. The only way I'd opt for this over them is if you have used and like Samsungs phones and apps, and want a phone for gaming (for which the Snapdragon X Elite chip is better for than the Tensor G4 in the Pixels)."
Hussain Shifan,Excellent service
J B,Great Price
AmazonMary Linda Johnson Customer,It was a very nice phone! Just to smart for me!
MikeS,Perfect fit for my S25+. Volume and power buttons are excellent. Plastic heavy duty screen protector woks but have spots that won't stick

Siavash A.,wonderful machine
Zaira Gonzalez,Excelente teléfono.
luckyman1,"The phone is packed with AI options, customizable, decent camera,nice display etc."
Tania,"It's crystal clear and clean picture and loud at max volume but it's my fault for not checking for a mirco SD card slot before buying it turns out the ultra series of samsung phones don't have an sd slot, and it turns out that if you just call your provider they can switch over your physical SIM card to the phone and that will change to a eSIM but the phone can mount 2 SIM cards and eSIM cards"
Amazon Customer,"Galaxy S25 mint green, is absolutely amazing. Brand new, easy to use, super fast."
Olena,So far I love this Samsung. Photos are very detailed! The battery holds well. Mint SIM is accepted without issues and the phone finds network after it drops. Happy!
Ryan,"Absolutely an amazing phone! Came in the original box from Samsung, works amazing! Black looks really nice. Easy to setup and use, and worth the money!"
Gabriela,"lo compre como un regalo y de verdad esta edición esta ESPECTACULAR, video, fotos, peso duración de la batería"
Adam Riley,Packaged very well . Delivery fast. Confirmed unlocked. Phone quality exceptional.
Tabascovich,"Good phone, seems well built, apps are all now working, I have 5G and Satellite but it's not really a worthy successor to my good old indestructible Galaxy S10. My old S10 is still snappy and a great solid and awesome phone but newer apps stop working and the battery is going flat so I decided to downgrade to the S25.

I downgraded to this new S25 just because my old flawless S10 battery was starting to fail, it did not have 5G, satellite and some of the more modern apps were starting to get buggy. If not for that, I would have waited for a newer generation."
Benjamin,Love Samsung
Deborah Ann Fraser,Returned this because they removed the camera shutter button on the stylus. Guess I was the 1% of users who actually used that function. Guess I'm going to have to hold onto the 24 until I have no choice but to get something new
