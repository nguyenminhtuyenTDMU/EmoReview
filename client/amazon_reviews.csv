Mary,"They're quality. They're affordable. They're durable. They clean up messes like nobody's business. What more is there to love??

I use these for my small business and they are fantastic. They wash up super well and they're such an amazing size for all types of cleaning. If you're looking for a good microfiber rag but don't want to pay prices for some of the other brands out there- give these a shot! I promise - you won't be disappointed."
Silver Cymbal,"Wish these had no tags but the price and quanity, and quality of these is very good. I get about a year from a box and they are invaluable for lots of cleaning tasks."
David Whang,"it's literally cheap microfiber cloths and not sure why you are reading this. for a 144 pack, how much quality do you expect? it's super cheap and works decent enough - it's not a Chemical Guys wooly mammoth but it does the job and allows you to chuck the super dirty ones. If you REALLY care about your paint, I doubt you'd be purchasing this anyways. these are great for just using around the house or to just do a quick and dirty job."
Julie Sands,"I purchased 144 of these and my spouse and I were able to stop using paper towels. This is how I made it work in our small kitchen. The space that would have been used for a paper towel holder is used instead for a more useful kitchen machine, a sodastream, on our counter. I estimate the time to maintain this microfiber towel system I have designed/developed/invented is equal to the amount of time my spouse and I would have spent getting and re-getting paper towels, storing them, placing them on the rolls, tearing them off, etc. Since our kitchen is small and we do not have a seperate room for a pantry, I decided to place our pantry, neatly, in an aesthetically pleasing way, throughout our small home. In this instance it was best to clear some cabinet space across from our sink. On one shelf we store our clean microfiber cloths. On another I repurposed a large plastic zippered bag with a cloth handle I got along with a comforter I purchased on Amazon. In it I placed an unplugged, uncapped Glade plugin Air Freshener which then works as a diffuser. The microfiber cloths that are used as paper towels to pick up crumbs (note most counter and oven straightening can best be accomplished with a Dyson Animal DC-44 with the crevice attachment on high,) I place in the homemade repurposed hamper (plastic zippered comforter bag with the air freshener) in another shelf in a closed cabinet. Any that are wet, or used to wipe up (can be sprayed with environmentally friendly all purpose Watkins cleaner sprayed on them) are placed by my spouse and I to dry on one of three coat trees we have. We have 2 metal ones in the bathroom we use for towels and clothes and one in the den we use for coats and these wet microfiber towels while they are drying. Then each time one of us goes to wash towels we throw the microfiber cloths in with them. The two of us never run out, nor worry if we forget to throw all the soiled ones in with a load of towels since we purchased 144 of them. Therefore I recommend if you implement this for yourself to accumulate/purchase144 of your own for 2 or 1 person, double that amount for 3 or 4 people before you do away with the paper towels. In the meanwhile buy recycled if at all possible. We also found out it was more ergonomic to get a very light trash receptacle in our kitchen that we can move about effortlessly to position near where we shake the crumbs off the towel or lift it up and wipe the crumbs right into it. Note the crevice tool of the Dyson DC Animal 44 is dishwasher safe-we wash it on the top rack. Watch out as some of the attachments have electrical connections in them and should not go in the dishwasher. The brush attachments are great for oven cleaning. I hate cleaning and so does my spouse but we love our home and so we have figured out easy, painless ways to keep it clean by thinking outside the box.
UPDATE: THANKS SO MUCH I was able to purchase more of these GREAT Microfiber Cloths-I and my spouse suffered a disaster caused by severe weather a few years ago and most of our microfiber cloths had tears, rips and huge holes in them as a result. We waited several years to see if we could repair them but have been inundated. Finally I was able to fit it in to my household partition to purchase more-I even use them as tissues, paper towels, to wash our two cars, etc., etc., so I am greatly relieved to have more of them sans holes, rips, etc. to use. Thanks Amazon folks-"

Emanuel,"We use these all the time at our manufacturing facility for cleaning glass/metal packaging. They're great and don't leave behind any lint. They are pretty thin and the absorbency isn't that good, but if you're using them for wiping down stuff versus cleaning up and absorbing messes, they're a great value."
megan f,"We use these daily on our dairy farm. They also get washed daily and after a few years, they are still holding strong! They absorb all the dirt and sand from the cows and moisture when we need it. They are used to wipe off iodine dip and get washed in bleach and have held up nicely! We also use them in our kitchen and ice cream truck where we use heavy duty soap and sanitize and they hold up well. The cloth is thicker than a normal towel. We have bought multiple cases"
LIUDMILA,I have been satisfied with my order for one year and I recommend it to everyone. The best assistant in the house
Erin J.,"I will not complain about the size since that is as advertised. I will, however, address other areas and quality issues.

Intended Use: I bought these primarily for car cleaning because my husband is meticulous about automotive detailing. I also do not use paper towels in the kitchen/home, so these will do cleaning duty, too.

Cons:
1) Each cloth is tagged with a large paper-like care label. For my husband, this is unacceptable because it's too scratchy and I'm inclinded to agree. So here we are, ripping off all of these labels.

2) They smell and feel weird. The care instructions say to wash with cool water before using. Normally (and with every other microfiber I've purchased) i would laugh this off. The smell and coating on them, however, was weird enough that i DID was them before using! And that only made the smell worse! And I'm not even a freak about ""chemicals!"" I actually compared them to some unused clothes I got from the home improvement store and they are substantially more coated, almost to the point of being tacky to the touch.

3) They are not good quality and I give them a year or less in the rotation before they are thrown away. This sounds okay, but considering we have good quality microfiber clothes that are now a decade old, it's a little wasteful. I was thinking the 144-count would last me YEARS.

Pros:
1) You get what you pay for. The bulk pricing is as cheap as I've seen, especially with subscribe and save. If you view these as fairly disposable, then you will not be disappointed.

Overall, I don't feel good about this purchase and will not buy again. I don't use paper products in the home because they're wasteful and expensive. Sadly, I think these are pretty wasteful too and they smell so weird, I wonder what part of the world they're poisoning with their production. Still, I'll make the best of it and use these for heavy cleaning. You do get what you pay when it comes to these things. High quality clothes make a huge difference. But if you cannot properly care for the high quality ones or you're using these with heavy solvents or soil, these make sense."
Cross,"These microfiber are good for one time auto exterior paint use. You must remove tag! I don’t know why they put tags on these. Then use on vehicle during paint correction, once dirty either throw away or wash only with other micro fibers and DO NOT dry! Use very little soap also, use sanitary mode on washer if you have it.

Throw away any that have any contaminates on them like saw dust etc. or they can be used for interior detailing or cleaning inside the house. If done right sometime you can get a couple uses out of them on paint. Be very careful, it’s easy to scratch car with dirty rag."
