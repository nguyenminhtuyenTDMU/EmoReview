2004 Forester,These wax applicators are great. I use them once or twice and wash for reuse. A very useful and multipurpose product. I also use to clean jewelry and other delicate items.
Unhappy,Arrived in a well packed bag. Quality pads that can be cleaned and reusable.
Cel,This pack of car wax applicator pads is a good value. The pads are well made and do the job. Recommend.
Laura J,"These are perfect for all your needs. I use some for cleaning, which they do a great job of, I have one I use to polish my furniture and it absorbs the right amount of polish and makes my furniture look awesome.
They are thick, the texture is good from washing dishes, cleaning counters, and streak free clean stainless appliances. So easy to use and fit in your hand great, and for the price I paid! Iâ€™m ordering more for sure! Fantastic value!"
Amazon Customer,this little Polise applicator works great
Kenneth Berg,Pads are great for applying car wax. They are washable and reusable. I just run them through the washer and dryer and they are ready for another application.
Somer,"I purchased these pads to use for polishing and waxing my car. Upon receiving them, I found them to be very thin, so I opted to spend more money to purchase thicker pads from a local retailer. The brands I observed had the same thickness, size, and were comparably priced to the pads I received. I cannot make any negative remarks about the pads I received, as I did not use them. I am sure others may have found them suitable."
Brandon Wooton,Good quality material. They work great when applying waxes and compounds to your vehicle.
Bates,Received in a well-sealed plastic package with product in good shape. They are thick and solid as is necessary.

Caine,Great product. Great Price..
Sheila Haas,Good value
J A,"I got these intending to use them with a waxing project, but the wax I bought came with a buffer. Instead, I have used these as cat toys and the cats have gone totally ham for them."
Robert Dreyer,"These work good,nice to have extras"
JasminBoss,"I like the fact this is microfiber so it is easy to pick up the wax or press wax globs into it. But it does not slide as smooth as foam applicators. When I move it on the car roof with a soft brush on a pole as the car is tall, it is not as easy to move it across the roof as the foam applicator. It does not seem to pick up dirt like the foam applicator does so maybe I wash it. But maybe after I use them up I will go back to foam applicator."
Nick,"Used to apply wax to my car. It's a good size for using your hands, durable and easy to apply I'll likely just use them once but still a good value for the money."
Marc Christensen,Good value for money and works well.
David Early,Needed new pads and this was a good value for several standard pads
Steve T.,Better than expected!
Bobby,Good quality at a great price! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
Ray,This is a good wax applicator. It's sturdy and probably washable for reuse.
Ben E,"Came well packaged and quickly, easy to use, as applicator on one side and then turn it over and use it to remove the dried wax or cleaner. Would buy again if needed. Good price and worth it."
Great boots and easy to wear all day.,Great product.

These are great microfiber pads for doing the interior of your car. They make hard to get places easy like in between your windshield and your dash I was able to get upholstery protectant down without having to come back and wipe the glass. They are great for applying tire shine they have a sponge built in so you donâ€™t splatter a bunch of extra product all over your freshly washed car."
Bob Pilcher,Nothing to dislike. Pretty standard applicator for automotive polish
Leo,"Good quality material. I will re-order these pads for my vehicle's detailing.

leo"
Julio excelente servicio,Buena calidad ðŸ‘Œ
Bugwhisker,"They'll do the job. I think they're worth the money. They are cheap. One edge is made flat probably due to how it's packaged side by side to fit in a box you'd expect photo paper to come in. Kind of wonky, but still pretty good for the price."
Mackobubis,No lint and hold up well. Good value
Juan C Rocha,"I use these often to apply either Chrome Polish or Car Wax, does the job well."
Kenneth Kaup,I needed something to wax my vehicles with and these are perfect.
mwtravlr,"They are quite small. 4"" diameer"
Dan Aguilar,"They work just fine, the material seems durable."
cgn,Although its a good quality the pad is not quite as soft as I had hoped
Amazon Customer,Good price and decent applicator.
Richard Barr,interesting package makes for decent storage for pads not in use yet. The Pads themselves are good but not as thick as I'd like. They'll do
Dwight,"The polishing pass were a great help when they arrived ontime as promised. Along with the product that ut was used for, I was satisfied and was able to complete my job."
David Karasik,Durable pad for buffing and polishing. Very absorbant.
sweet,Not for buffing but for sponges. Wash easily
Justin F.,"Good for price, easy to use,"
k,Just as Advertised. Easy to use.
Rick,"Great value for the money !
Works great !"
J. Curnett,I bought these vs. the ones that I bought from The Chemical Guys. They are a lesser performing pad and will do in a pinch. Not overall impressed. OK to buy
Alli B.,Streaks a lot but probably just my error. Good material so far
The Duck,They work well for adding wax or whatever to your fresh washed car.
707173,This brand is not the best. Too thin.
PDX Reider,"Have bought, used and tossed many these to apply various waxes to cars. Right size, applies smooth layer.
OTwp sides, soft, and when done not so expensive they can't be tossed."
Nick,I just use them to apply wax to the surface of my industrial wood equipment and they work well to get a layer of wax on
Mc Mann,Good quality and cheap price.
VTC,Great for waxing and are portable.
PKW,We use these in the kitchen and they work great as a kitchen sponge.
Troy,"These work just as well as any name-brand ones youd fine at the parts store, and 6 in a pack is a great deal in my opinion. I used two for a day of intense detailing and then washed them, they still look brand new. I imagine you can get quite a few uses out of these things"
Zak,"Spread or absorb, sponge or push. These disks are great products to use for detailing cars"
Jill Pfefferle,"These wash nicely after use. I will add that they are slightly thicker than the average pad you would purchase. Not so much a negative, just if you are a woman, they might not be as comfortable in your hand"
MR. FUN,"GREAT WAX APPLICATOR PADS, GREAT PRICE!"
Eddie Banks,They work good value
Eddie,Wax goes on easy and smoothly. The pads clean up like new in the washer. Great product!
MPG Guy,"Nice quality, good price."
Reg,"Internal foam does not expand enough, even after washing."
Mike S.,"These arrived vacuum packed so I expected considerable expansion once opened. Didnâ€™t happen. Given time to expand they were still pretty thin, nothing like the foam applicator pads that come with most car waxes. These did the job spreading the wax but they were more difficult to hold on to than thicker foam ones."
Frank Brown,holds the paste wax and easy to apply wax only problem was when I received the pads one was stick to the shipping bag when they sealed it closed had to return but was able to get replacement without any problem
Dave Clark,The pads are washable
just-one,For my needs & wants the thickness is just right. I have washed them a couple of times after use and find the quality to be good. They are not too large ao for ease of use is spot on. I found the price point good for the amount of pads in the order. They are soft and versatile enought to use for a variety of uses
TR,"These pads are great, I am using them on my car for waxing and tire shine. You can use them for whatever you want."
Muhammad Nageen,Idk.
Tom,Worked as advertised
Jeff,"I use it to apply wax to table saw and jigs. For plywood jigs, having a finish first duck as lacquer then use this."
Gregory Villerot,"These worked well, but they were small and not very durable"
Jim G.,Great for applying wax or buffing it out. Seem well made.
Phil Gallegos,Good price

James O,A necessary tool to wax your car
Anibal Quinones,Es bueno para aplicar cera al carro.
MARK GERNER,WORK WELL WOULD USE AGAIN
IPH,"These pads have a very thin sponge inside.
They may be good for some things like wax, as they are sold, but not optimal for wood stain application as some others that are available prove.
The unfortunate reality is that most of the applicator terry sponges on Amazon look identical on the site... Trial & Error."
Amazon Customer,good pads. made the job easier.
Amazon Customer,"Absorbent for wax, soft on finish

Hold up really well.
Great value."
