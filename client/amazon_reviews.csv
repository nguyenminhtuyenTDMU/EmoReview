Coffeytalk,"The Instant Pot Pro 10-in-1 has been a game-changer in my kitchen! It’s incredibly versatile and has streamlined my cooking process like never before. With functions for pressure cooking, slow cooking, sautéing, steaming, and even sous vide, it feels like I have an entire kitchen staff in one appliance.

The rice/grain cooker feature is a standout—it cooks everything perfectly, whether it’s fluffy white rice or quinoa. I also love the yogurt-making function, which has made homemade yogurt part of my weekly routine. The sauté feature is great for browning meat or onions before switching to slow or pressure cooking, all in the same pot—no extra dishes to wash!

What really impressed me was the intuitive design. The upgraded inner pot with stay-cool handles makes it so easy to handle, and the multiple cooking presets save time and guesswork. Cleanup is also a breeze; the pot and lid are dishwasher-safe.

If you’re looking for a multi-functional, reliable appliance that saves time and delivers delicious results, the Instant Pot Pro is worth every penny. Highly recommended for busy households or anyone who loves experimenting in the kitchen!"
Rebecca,"No issues, and I bought 6qt for my rv, and the 8qt for home. So versatile and convenient! The features are excellent and it's easy to use. This one seems to be of better quality than the previous ones I've owned, it's my 4th model, and this brand has lasted the longest so far! I make lots of things in it, but my favorite to make is beans. Crock pot lasagna is a fave too! It's easy to clean, and this brand has a lot of accessories as well. It is a little bulky to store, but it's usefulness outweighs the storage."
aksline,"I am 100% obsessed with my instant pot and use it every single day - our stove was out of commission for a while, so I started using this and even when our stove worked, I kept using it. It's SO EASY, truly one pot cooking. Honestly, the only buttons it NEEDS are ""manual"" (for pressure cooking), ""slow cook"" and ""saute,"" because you have full customization within those three options for pressure, temperature, cook time etc, but it has tons of options for those who just want to push one button and be done with it!

It's stainless, so it's not leaching anything into to your food, and it pressure cooks AND does slow cooking.

I LOVE the Pro. I was using the Instant Pot Duo for years, and when it finally died last year I upgraded to the pro and could not be happier with the upgrade for 3 main reasons:

a) the handles on the pot inserts! I can finally easily lift and remove the insert when something needs to come off the heat (and/or to switch out inserts to make something else). Oh my gosh, I can't believe these handled pot inserts aren't standard on every style of instant pot. With their OTHER style, the Duo, there aren't any handles, just a thin lip around the pot, which means lifting the insert (when full) is a precarious, hot affair.

b) the high/low saute function. This was a GAME-CHANGER! In the duo, with only the HIGH setting, it was easy to burn things when sauteeing pre-pressure cooking. Now I can even make perfectly cooked scrambled eggs in this thing.

c) the timer that you can set for AFTER cooking! With pressure cooking, sometimes you need a 10-min release, sometimes 5-mins, and you can program that right in so it'll beep to alert you when it's time to release the remaining pressure - I LOVE that! It does everything for you.

I WILL SAY: the ""low"" setting on slow cook seems a little TOO low. When I do something on low for a lot of hours - it almost never seems done so I often have to follow up with a couple of minutes of pressure cooking to make sure it's finished - which isn't ideal. I'm not sure if that's an overall design flaw or just MY particular unit. But I mostly slow cook on high, and that's never been an issue."
orson corson,"My wife and I were on a pursuit to eat healthier. We wanted to do more home prep and less processed box type food. This seemed like the right option.

I was so inspired by the YouTube fans of instant pot I bought one for me and one for two of my sons (and their wives). I use it about 3-4 times a week. Everything works outstanding and the recipes have been top notch. French onion soup is amazing, macaroni and cheese is incredibly easy (you don’t drain the pasta) and some of the Italian dishes my wife and son have made are excellent.

I make yogurt in it about 2 times a week. It’ll maintain a steady 100 degrees when needed but you can set it to whatever temp is needed.

Really inspiring and a terrific addition to the kitchen. I’ve got quite a few books from the Libby app using the local library online. Great recipes and they make you venture into new food territory. The online help from fellow instant pot fans is extremely helpful. These things are well loved.

Excellent!"
Genuine Insight & Practical Perspective,"The Instant Pot Pro 10-in-1 is an excellent multi-cooker with various functions, such as pressure cooking, slow cooking, sautéing, and even sous vide. Its 6-quart size is perfect for small to medium families, and the app with over 800 recipes is a fantastic bonus for meal inspiration.

However, I returned it because I found an 8-quart version at Costco for a much cheaper price. While this product is excellent, it doesn’t make sense to keep it when a larger, more cost-effective option is available."
Linda Smith,"This Instant Pot Pro 10-in-1 has officially made me feel like a kitchen pro without actually requiring any real cooking skills. It pressure cooks, slow cooks, sautés, steams—basically, it does everything except wash the dishes afterward. Meals that used to take hours now magically appear in under 30 minutes, and I finally understand why people swear by these things. If you love delicious, home-cooked meals but also enjoy maximum laziness, this is the appliance for you."
Ashton Emmitte,"I upgraded from Instapot Duo to the Pro. The fact the Instapot Pro has handles makes a world of different. On the Duo it is was a pain pulling the pot out and straining it while hot. On top of that it inner-pot of this ""Pro"" has a heavy bottom making a great is steel pot, so it just work like a normal pot on the stove top giving me the options in using either the electrical device or on the stove top. When in doubt get the 6 qt, is fits most things for a 1-4 person household (I'd argue even 6). Might not hold a Large whole chicken, but I manage by being able to breakdown a whole chicken (it isn't hard, just watch a video)

I cook professionally. But at home the Instapot is the best appliance I've gotten. I make Bean from dried at a fraction of the time, amazing quality fresh stock that doesn't require me to to wait 8 hours on a stove top, it takes the place of crockpot, rice cooker (*), and a normal pot. Stews, Gumbo, Chili, and Braises are done greatly when you are pinch for time making what would normally for 5 hour is only an hour or two and near same quality. Which has saved me during a dinner party where my sous dropped braised short ribs 2 hours before plating.

It is an investment but if you eat (or plan to eat) legumes/beans, and you use stock/broth occasionally or consistently in your diet. This will save you some money and time while giving you a better product than store-bought stock/broth and canned beans. Both the beans and stock you make freeze well, and cooked frozen bean reheat/thaw fast. And if you freeze veggie scrap (like onion skin, carrot/parsnip peel, celery tops and bottoms) as well and save bones from you chicken (rotisserie, chicken thigns, or whole chicken) you can make stock with all the stuff you were going to throw way anyway. Better than store bought while also being basically free. Lastly it is great for meal prep and you can set it to have your ingredients in it before leaving to work and being done by the time you get home from work.

If you cook consistently for yourself and/or for loved ones, or want to cook more at home. An Instapot makes thing easy at a press of a button, and the Pro has very convent features (like HANDLES I cant praise enough!) that make life much more easy. When you get one you will ask also ask ""Why didn't I get one sooner?"". I work late nights and early morning, this gives me more time and saves me from eating out.

~*I've mentioned ""rice cooker"" and I want to expand on this.~
The Instapot works great as a rice cooker but compared to an actual rice cooker, it is a little slower to cook (20min vs 30-35min) and the rice (especially short-grain/sushi rice) builds starch and stick to the stainless steel pot, requiring a slight bit more finesse to clean. I personally eat rice (and grains) consistently and i like saving 10-15min of what little time I have at home, so i have both a cheap rice cooker and instapot. However if you want to minimize your appliances (i.e. have less ""appliance clutter"") and need to conserve space in your kitchen, then having just an Instapot will work well enough and do every thing a rice cooker can, plus much MUCH more."
kira,I love it. I love that the pot has handles. My older one didn't and I always said I wish it just came with handles. I was excited when my old one died and I saw this. The pressure is amazing and it always leaves my meat so tender. I love instant pot. I know their quality on their products are amazing. It is so easy to clean and I love the size. I have the 6qt and it perfect for my family of 5. It makes dinner some nights speedy on those long days at work.
Amazon Customer,"Listen folks, it’s all about the inner pot. My trusty Cosori pressure cooker died after 8 years. I use the Corosi weekly, since I’m 80% plant based. Simple, easy to use with a heavy duty stainless steel inner pot. My daughter and I, did massive research on the best pressure cooker. Simple, wanted a 6 quart, electronic multiple cooker with a stainless steel pot. Why a stainless pot and not a pot that is clad in stainless with a ceramic coating? The pressure is so high that after a period of time, the inner coating will begin to peel. Check the reviews. This is not healthy cooking. After reviewing every site, including Amazon, there were only two options that had a stainless steel pot. Daughter brought the Instant Pot Pro with the stainless steel pot. Did contact Corosi, and wanted to know if my stainless steel pot would fit their new model. No, it would not fit.
So, at this point, I needed to have a pressure cooker for all those dried legumes. I also bought the Instant Pot Pro. It works, it’s easy and has a very nice stainless steel pot. I do not use the prescribed settings for the pressure cooker function. For example, pre soaked, kidney beans, take 9-11 minutes on high. The prescribed setting, is for dried beans, 20-30 minutes. Pre soaked beans will be like mush. I use the custom setting, set my own time and so far, I am pleased with the outcomes.
Another bit of advice. I do not use the inner pot to sauté. The surface area is too small. I use a frying pan, build up my ingredients and seasonings and transfer to the inner pot.
Will I use the Instant Pot, multiple functions? Probably not. If you don’t have a stove, then those functions could be very helpful.
I will update my review if this model of Instant Pot, dies from some type of electrical malfunction.
Keep your pressure cooker clean, extends the life of the unit. Tons of recipes out there.
Lastly, most of the electric, multifunctional pressure cookers are made in China. I suspect the prices will go up considerably."
sam,"Well I gave away my yogurt maker,rice cooker, small pressure cooker, and probably will soon find a home for my 70 ' s green crockpot with the brown ceramic liner ( but maybe not...I'm attached). The insta pot covers all the bases.
I have had an insta pot in the past but it was not the premium stainless steel and believe me it makes a difference. The nickel leaks into the food and I was very turned off by the metallic taste. No such problem so far. And this one is very heavy duty nothing cheap about it. So far I've used it for bbq ribs and 15 bean soup. Very powerful. I presoaked the beans but really not necessary. 55 min obliterated them which is what I want. I care for elderly parent with chewing challenges and this is going to be a big help. She misses meat. A small whole chicken would fit nicely on the cooking rack, or roast. ( See Mary's Nest YouTube for good chicken demo).
I found a spot on top of the fridge for storage. Counter space is not an option unless cooking. The 6 qt is plenty big for 2-4 people.
Easy clean up. I look forward to learning more ways to utilize."
Amazon Customer,"We went from never having an instant pot to using this 4 or 5 days out of the week for meals. This thing can cook a roast so much faster than a crockpot and my kid is always using it to make rice. I still don't know how to use everything on it but I can say it was a great purchase. You can tell it is sturdy and reliable and the meat comes out tender. If you're on the fence, go for it."
S. Tilghman Hawthorne,"This is a replacement for my old duo because the duo wouldn't work with the saute feature - when you tried to pressure cook after sauteeing, it would be overheated.<pain> so far this one works fine. The only issue is it doesn't have a zero minute function."
Shreem,As a single mom this instant pro pot is a life saver! Even my lazy meals come out gourmet! I was nervous about pressure cooking but its so easy to use. Just make sure you dont overfill it.
Tony/Toni,"I scored this as an ""open box"" item for ~$70! I don't make many dishes with it, but doing more with it as time goes on. I used to make soup on the stove or slow cooker, simmering for hours, but now I can cook the soups in 15 minutes! Preparing the ingredients is much more time consuming than the cooking part now. Lately, I have learned (I'm still evolving my method) to make yogurt from fat-free milk. Yogurt costs me less than half the price of store-bought now (not including my time and the electricity cost), and I'm talking about the 32 oz vanilla variety which currently costs me ~$2.75 at Walmart. It tastes better, and I can make it any way I want, with the ingredients I choose. My Mom used to make things on the stove with the old-style pot with the weight on the lid to select different pressures--I find the Instant Pot quite an improvement.

Here's the kicker: I likely would not have happened on pressure cooking if I didn't do a stint at an Amazon DC as line worker. I used to make jokes about ""Instant Pot"" (use your imagination) when they came down the line, which was quite often, for I had no idea what the device was for until my curiosity about it cause investigation of the matter.

Usage tip for yogurt making: Don't discard the whey! It's nutritious, and is useful. I drink it straight and put it in smoothies as a substitute for most of the milk. No waste!"
wildmare0,"Does everything a slow cooker and pressure cooker do, plus rice cooker too and pretty easy to clean also pressure cook function is silent. Instructions say it will also bake but I have not tried that yet.. I replaced multiple appliances with this so I say 'good value' here."
Suzanne V. Kostenko,I bought this small appliance as a Christmas present. However the person it was bought for already had the same unit. Thus I cannot give an actual review of this product but I was assured that it is a reliable appliance and works as described. I returned this item.
Heather,"I don't think this pot works as well as my Evo did.
It takes longer to preheat. Cooking from frozen, yes, I forget to thaw meat sometimes, takes longer to cook It doesn't hold quite as much food.
I still love being able to cook a fairly fast meal with good flavor."
psfollett,"I got this to replace an ""off brand"" that I've had for years that still worked but had a fairly scratched up non-stick coating and it always irritated me that it would spin around when I would do things like sauté meat. This version of Instant Pot takes care of both of those issues since it has the stainless steel insert with handles that lock it into position.

Having all the base options plus the ability to customize the settings (and save a few favorites) is definitely a game changer for me. My old pot had some basic options of slow cook/pressure cook/brown/keep warm and then I would have to always set the timer - no default settings onscreen. I like this interface and was one of the driving factors for picking this particular model.

So far, I've done a couple pot roasts (both slow and pressure cooked) and a LOT of yogurt in it and have been quite satisfied with the results. I appreciate having the 2 silicone rings so I use the white one for fermenting my batch of yogurt and the red one for everything else (i.e., red=meat, white=milk, so super easy to remember which one I've designated for what). It's relatively easy to switch them out. I also appreciate being able to put the lid in the dishwasher. I *maybe* could have done that with my old cooker since its lid looked quite similar, but I don't recall ever seeing that noted in the instructions, although admittedly I think I owned that one for about 10 years so did not look at the instructions.

Because I have historically tended to do the yogurt and slow cooking more often than pressure cooking, I would prefer that the default on the lid be that pressure is off (this is how my old cooker worked), or even to have a choice of which one one wants to have as the default, especially since the mechanism is a switch. And the switch could even be color coded, say p=purple/pink/puce/pomegranate/manufacturer's other ""p"" color of choice=PRESSURE, so if you see a color then you know it's set to the pressure option and if you don't see a color you know it's set to the no pressure option. Something for them to consider, especially since the words that are molded onto the lid aren't painted, so it is tough to read which setting I'm at if I look later to make sure I either turned off pressure or left it set depending on the particular need.

I do wish it actually came with an instruction book rather than only having an online option. Sure, I can use my phone or tablet and have it near by, but sometimes being able to flip to a dog eared page is way more convenient. I'm not saying to get rid of the online option, just suggesting to augment it with a small booklet, even just as a quick start.

Lastly, for my pressure cooking, once I did with a slow release so it didn't make any noise, and the other I did a quick release and it did seem quieter than what I recall my old one sounded like. I assume this is the cover over the pressure valve is diffusing the steam as it is released. That's a nice feature."
DodgeThis,The dial mechanism takes getting used to and you are still pushing button so not sure why they didn't stick to that. But other wise cooks just as fine. And quality is great no complaints. Taking 1 star off for the dial mechanics.
Art W.,"Pressure cooking is superb. We had a slow cooking recipe for pork tenderloin we wanted to try, but after adding all the ingredients to the pot and following the instruction book for slow cooking, an hour went by and the pre-heating light hadn't even moved. Cancelled the slow cooking and found a pressure cook recipe which, two hours later, produced perfectly cooked pork and veggies. Made some inquiries on Youtube and found then only way to slow cook with the Instantpot is to add water to the pot and use the Saute setting to heat the pot. Once it gets hot, then add the food to the pot, cancel the Saute cycle, and start the slow cooker. Kind of a pain to do that compared to our old pressure cooker/slow cooker combo. So have to dock one star, but overall happy with the pressure cooking portion."
momof9,I use this for making 36hours yogurt lie the book Super Gut recommends. It works well. It has variable temperatures for the yogurt setting.
M. Wagner,This item was recommended to me by my sister who has a similar but larger instapot. I wasn’t sure how to use this. A basic quick start guide comes with it. The user manual is online which is frustrating for me . I prefer a book specific to the model I buy that comes with an item. I bought it for someone else in my household as a gift but have used it more than they have and I think it is because it doesn’t have a book with it.
Minaa Ramirez,LOVE! I finally caved and got a pressure cooker. I’m so glad I went with this one. I ordered it and with prime it came the same day. I just have to learn recipes and I’m so excited
Susan,"This has revolutionized my homemade yogurt making. I make yogurt every couple of days. Two caveats. Don't use the pressure cooker lid as it sticks and is almost impossible to get off. I've read other people have had this problem, too. And buy the glass lid for cooking. Mine cost $20 but has made yogurt making so much easier."
SGB,"Husband loves this. He cooks almost everyday with it.
Only reason I didn't give 4 stars is the base of the cook pot is not sealed well. It still works."
DAVID JAMES BINKLEY,Great and fast for cooking legumes!
Mark,Great machine- it has paid for itself very early on as l consume a lot of yogurt. High quality yogurt is rather expensive and with a small investment it only makes sense in the long run.
D. R. Hatton,"I purchased this as a replacement for my stove, top pressure cooker. The digital controls allow me to leave this appliance unattended, which is a time saver as well as a safety feature. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about safety and convenience.."
Johann Valderrama,"La considero dentro de las mejores compras que he hecho para mi cocina! Es una magnifica inversión. Luego de mi compra, mi familia también la quizo en sus casas. No lo dudes es una gran elección!"
MK,This is a great product. It’s very versatile and I’ve been using it a lot more often than I anticipated. I highly recommend it!
Rita,"Makes great yogurt! I found helpful recipes in a book called Super Gut by W. Davis.
We’ve also made many soups, rice, and meat meals. Love it!"
Jo Parker,"This gift was a Christmas present for my daughter and son-in-law. They had a smaller one, but thought this larger one would be better for 2 to 4 servings. They love it."
Gary,"It functions as advertised. It keeps the temperature at a precise level, and it’s easy to operate"
Thekkepat Sekhar,Absolutely wonderful. Have used it so many times.
Sheridan S.,"Works well so far. Between this, and air frier, an electric skillet, and a microwave oven, I feel I'm covered for home cooked meals. Just made pea soup. A lot of it. This thing would probably work well for a family. Large capacity. I'm satisfied so far."
Junebug,"Click to play video
Big fan of Instant Pot products. Once our old one of 7 yrs finally died, we upgraded to the Pro model. Love all the additional features and improvements. Like the handles on the pot and the button vent. Only criticism is that it always seems to take at least 5-6 pushes of the button to get it to do anything. Even just to turn on the sauté mode requires more than just pressing saute and start. But I do appreciate that this is partly due to there being lots more options - definitely like that the sauté temp can be customized so it’s not just raging hot!"
Dawn Starks,"I don't know what took me so long to get this. I can cook an entire dinner in this and it's all done within 2 hours. Cooks turkey wings that fall off the bone and tender. I like that it let you custom set up cooking time and or use the presets. It is easy clean up, the liner pot (like a crock pot) comes out for easy cleaning. It is to too heavy to store up into a pantry. the pot portion it is stick proof. It don't look like your average clean pot when cleaned and dry. It looks not clean, and another flaw I can live with. Its the size of the average 6 quart crock pot. It hold the smell from cooking long after cleaning, that's a flaw I can work around. It is built sturdy and heavy duty pot. the display is easy to read and easy to cook with. I would recommend this for a person whom wants a good meal in less than 3 hours."
Dr. Live Your Life,"I love it, and use it to cook soups and stews super quickly. It's my go-to meal maker."
Yunnamd,It works as it should be. I like the pan with handles. It was my pain when I had the old one.
Julia,Definitely worth buying! I use it in both slow cooker and pressure cooker modes—it saves a lot of effort.
"Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm","purchased this on the black friday sale so got a better deal on it, as so am very pleased with the purchase. this model is easy to clean, the stainless steel inner pot and the entire lid can be run thru the dishwasher if needed which is very nice. It comes with a clear and colored silicone seal for the lid so that you can use one for savory dishes and the other it you are doing sweet dishes or just keep the other as a backup. Very easy setup and I made beef stew from my own recipe and it was excellent and ready in about an hour including prep, cook and natural vent for 10 minutes before manual vent release. This was my first time using a pressure cooker or multicooker like this and was very happy with the unit and the results. Highly recommended."
Mimi,"Love everything about this pot, easy to use and clean, love the handles and woks very well"
Granite,"This thing is just absolutely fantastic. Easy to use, the handles are a great design, makes it easy to lift out the pot and to stir when in saute mode. The only thing I would change is to add a custom time for the delay time on natural pressure release since some recipes call for times other than 5 or 10 minutes. I've been cooking almost every night for several weeks trying out new recipes and the flavors I've been able to get have been great, lilke Thai, Moroccan, Greek, etc. Checkout Urvashi Pitre's books, especially the Keto and Mediterranean ones. You don't have to be on those diets to enjoy the meals. You can also checkout the website twosleevers for more recipes. I've now made a Thai yellow curry coconut soup, Navy bean soup, Moroccan chickpea soup and Mulligatawny that will always be somewhere in the winter rotation."
Holly Sun,"It is truly versatile, powerful, made with high-quality materials, and very affordable. Unlike some products that boast about using a stainless steel inner lining as if it were something incredibly high-end, this purchase has been a great success. I absolutely love it."
Scott M,I bought this after my steamer broke. I figured I could try pressure cooking and it would be a fun thing to do. Its certainly a sturdy device. It's not a flimsy product. It's has so many helpful tools while it cooks your food. The thing is great.
Kindle Customer,My mom loves her gift! She really appreciates how easy it was to use.
Frequent Buyer,"I love this instant pot! The first one I received may have been someone else’s return. I think it may have had missing parts and you had to really wrestle with the lid to get it off. The lid kept getting stuck so I returned it and they sent me a replacement right away, and so far it’s working great. Love it!"
Susan,"Never thought I needed an instant pot. Once I got it, pressure cooking has been a game changer. This model is the best version of the instant pot in my opinion—all customizable options, the favorites buttons, can make my L Reuteri yogurt too. Perfect corned beef every time, easy soup in less than two hours—really it’s amazing. I’m coming back for the 8-quart model next."
brittania,This is much smaller than I thought it would be. But the way it is made is very nice and it cooks well.
HudsonD,"I bought this for my vacation house and like it far more than I thought I would. At my main house, I have a “real” pressure cooker, “real” slow cooker, “real” rice cooker, etc. I was really an instant pot skeptic But none of those do I have at the other home, so thought why not give it a go. I love it! Does it work as well as my stand-alone items. No, but…. Most of my friends would never use a pressure cooker if not for the instant pot, so it opened up a lot of people to this fantastic way of cooking. It isn’t great at slow cooking but rarely do I use that function, as slow cooking can usually be replaced by pressure cooking."
temartin,"My first owned Instant pot, I use it everyday. I should of bought one a LONG time ago! I use this for my channel and in personal life.. It is so easy to use and food comes out perfect every time.."
Laxmikant,"I know they have a pro plus version for app support but this one is expensive too and the app support would have given a better deal.
No problems in the usage otherwise."
veloth,Love it. Works so well.
Andy Pargh,This is my third Instant Pot and this one is my favorite!
Jerry,"This works very well so far. As they highly recommend, READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AND CAUTIONS. I made white rice with it today and it worked just fine on the default setting. I will venture onto making other things, but I didn't find anything in the included little recipe booklet that I am interested in trying. The sealing O ring is sort of hard to replace, (they recommend it be removed and cleaned after every use.) They also say it should be replaced approximately every 8 - 12 months, so you might want to buy replacements while you are at it. (Mine came with one replacement)"
Kurry,"Bought Jun 22, 2021.

Minor annoyance: The rectangular plastic around the digital screen with the different settings like ""pressure cook"" ""slow cook"" ""saute"" ""bake"" is a sticker sheet. My unit that I've bought has a quirk where the pressure cook button corner of the plastic sticker is often lifting off though I'm able to just press it back into place. This happened as soon as I bought the thing. The rest of the model is built solidly and I don't worry about safety. I've seen the videos of older models spluttering hot steam when venting and this one is a breeze. In context of the older models, I am not afraid of pressure and burning. But, the button section of this model feels cheap.

I've used the metal pot that is removeable has been used on the gas stove - I don't know if this is advised by the manufacturer but I have frequently used it on the open flame to consolidate the amount of pots I have out. It has not exploded yet. There is a miniscule crack on the lip of the metal pot and I don't know if it's because of the many times I've used this pot or because it wasn't supposed to be on the oven in the first place. No biggy.

It is phenomenal in saving attention span in specific mindless chores. I use it for boiling eggs or making chicken stock.

Thick food recipes might not be for pressure cooking. Japanese curry, though golden curry brand probably doesn't have instructions for this, tended to smell burnt(?) because there's no way to mix it while it's actively cooking inside. Am still looking forward to trying to make some yogurt with this though.

Overall, I haven't used this appliance all that much especially in the beginning years of owning this (hence - me using the instantpot's metal pot for the stove to get some use out of it?). I'm using my imagination for what could be cooked with the instant pot especially with menial tasks but it does live in my cabinet a lot of the times."
Rose W,I asked for a lid replacement…they don’t have. So I only was able to use for a week
Rosemary Snyder,I have learned how to use this and i love it. Recipes already on the internet...so far I can not use it for pork chops and have good results but everything else i have been very pleased with.
Brian,"I purchased the Instant Pot Pro to replace an older model I had been using for nearly a decade. The upgrade has been absolutely worth it, especially after using this new model several times a week over the past few months.

One of the standout features is the sous vide mode. I've monitored the temperature with an external thermometer, and the Instant Pot Pro’s temperature sensor is impressively accurate. I’ve used this mode about a dozen times so far, and it’s been a delightful experience each time.

As expected, pressure cooking remains the core strength of this system. It heats up quickly and maintains a secure seal for 30-40 minutes after the cooking cycle completes, ensuring consistently excellent results.

The sauté mode has seen noticeable improvements over my older Instant Pot. It reaches higher temperatures faster, making it much more efficient for browning and sautéing.

I’m particularly impressed with the pressure release valve on this model. Unlike older versions, this valve directs steam through a chamber, preventing it from shooting up onto the walls or cabinets, which makes for a much cleaner and safer release process.

The only quirk I’ve encountered is with the slow cook mode, which seems to be a common topic of discussion on forums and YouTube. The unit can take up to an hour to go from preheating to cooking. The recommended solution is to use the high-temperature setting and add 15 minutes for every hour you’d typically use a dedicated slow cooker. This adjustment has worked wonderfully for all my slow-cooked dishes. I don’t deduct a star for this issue since the primary function is pressure cooking, and the slow cook feature is more of a bonus.

Lastly, the inner pot is easy to clean. It’s made of stainless steel, so it withstands a good scrub without any damage. I also give it a quick polish with Barkeepers Friend every month or so to keep it looking brand new."
Amazon Customer,"I've used this 4 times now, I really like the simplicity of the operation, and number of recipes on the Internet. The 6 quart size is perfect for a family of 4 or less. I don't like big appliances, if it's a really large item that's what ovens are for. This replaces an older ChefIQ that I disliked, it was continually losing WiFi settings, and dropping it's app/recipes right in the middle of meal preparation. I am glad to switch to an easy to use appliance, with no need for WiFi. The cleanup is easy too. I evaluated ninja version, but I already have a toaster oven with an air fry setting and I have no desire to make my own yogurt, so this was my best option."
BPalmer,"Yummy...that's what you will say after making all of the different kinds of foods that you can cook with this. I bought this for my wife to replace one we have had for years and years and the steam release knob had just broken on it. This is so much better and there are even more ways to cook with it. From frozen roast to dinner table in like an hour and it's so tender and great. So many options that we haven't put it away yet and have just left it on the counter to cook with it every other night or so. Every kitchen needs one of these, and this is the best I have seen yet."
Ron Schweizer,Improved since earlier model.
Al Darroch,"Looks great, very excited to use it. On my second recipe this week, and I have only had it 1 week."
A. Hicks,"This was to replace a 7 or 8 year old instant pot that got a fair amount of use, but finally faulted out upon reaching pressure. I've used this new model once so far, to make stock from a Thanksgiving turkey carcass. It worked fine, so now I have two quarts of frozen stock for future batches of instant pot soup. I really like the fast pressure release, and the cooking vessel handles, which my prior instant pot did not have. Overall the technical details are much better than the prior unit.

Updated Jan 19, 2025:
I've now used this instant pot several times more to make vegetable, bean, rice, corn, turkey soup, which I freeze in 1 cup portions for 16 or so lunches per batch. It works really well, and I'm quite happy with this unit."
Catherine Clontz,"MODEL: Instant Pot Pro 10-in-1 Pressure Cooker

I only just jumped onto the Instant Pot wagon. A longtime holdout (mainly due to the price), I saw a whole chicken cooked in one in half an hour and thought ""I wanna do that too!"" So here I am.

Pros:
• It's super practical.
• It doesn't heat up your house!!!
• There isn't much that won't fit, and there are literally 1000s of recipes available all over the place.
• It's incredibly easy to clean, except for the steam vent (see below).
• The book that comes with it will literally walk you through each and every step of each and every thing you do until you know for sure what you're doing.
• Lots of pre-programmed stuff makes life easier!
• You can make a fast gravy for that chicken IN THE POT while you toss the bird under a quick broil to crisp up the skin!
• It comes with an extra seal for the lid so you're not left waiting if the first one dies. Helpful, that!
• Timer for pressure release. If you have ever had a regular pressure cooker, you know how looooooooong that takes. This has two pre-programmed timers: 5 minutes and 10 minutes. I've used both multiple times with the same results - fully released and ready to open without wanting to blow up in my face. Fantastic! No more dances with the pressure button screaming as you try to manually move the thing for a ""quick"" release. Oh, and this DOES have a manual release switch for fast venting, but the only time I used it was when I did the water test when I first bought it. Infinitely more practical to have the machine time it out for me.

Cons:
• Lots of accessories available, but nothing actually comes with the pot except a two-handled rack. Don't tell me you can do all this and that and then not provide any tools with which to do any of it.
• That steam vent cleaning conundrum. Maybe it's just me, but I haven't figured out how to properly clean that thing, and my concern is goop buildup in the holes from the steam. Please note that this hasn't happened yet - it's just a concern.
• That's it. Nothing else.

Honestly, I *highly* recommend this machine. After more than a decade of putting it off, I'm kicking myself for my own stubborn nature. I looked at all the models and read a gazillion professional reviews before I went with this one. I've used all of the features (not necessarily for their stated purposes, but hey, a girl must be creative occasionally), and I've been incredibly satisfied. If you've been holding out or just cant decide which model, get this one. You'll LOVE it, and you will never look back!"
Lorene K.,"I just discovered that this pressure cooker doesn’t allow for zero minute pressure cooking. You cannot set it to 0 minutes as some recipes call for, unlike my older, cheaper IP. Yes, I can set it for 1 minute then hang around until I hear the pressure cooking beep to stop it. But it would be better if I could set it for 0 minutes with a 5 minute release alarm. Didn’t expect an upgraded appliance to progress backwards. Too bad. For other recipes, this model works good."
Ada L. King,It produces better dishes than if I used a dutch oven. Because it cooks in a sealed environment all the flavors remain in food--nothing is lost to the outside. I find I need much less water when making rice because not a drop escapes the pot.
Amazon Customer,Perfect except you cannot set the cook time for 0 minutes like previous models. You'd do this for quinoa or steamed broccoli.
Jeffrey S,"I bought this to replace my Nija Foodie. Since I have a microwave with a built-in air fryer, I no longer needed that particular feature. I chose this model over the basic Instapot because of the front display. I prefer an intuitive display rather than simply a bunch of buttons to push.
This model is surprisingly light considering the features and quality of build. First of all, the pot insert is stainless steel with a heavy disk at the bottom. I assume that this disk MAY have an aluminum core for even heating. Because it's stainless steel, it is dishwasher safe.
The front display is VERY intuitive without having to always run to the owner's manual to figure out how to use it.
It preheats quickly and keeps you informed throughout the process of cooking or pressure cooking. So far, I have pressure cooked a Boston Butt for shredded pork, pressure cooked hard-boiled eggs (to perfection, I may add) and pressure cooked baby back ribs. Everything turned out perfectly.
I don't anticipate using the rice feature, as I have seen reviews online that most of these gadgets give mixed results - I prefer to use the stovetop method. I also haven't used the sous-vide feature yet - I already have Sous-Vide immersion device that I use for larger quantities of food. However, when I have the chance to use the feature for a small batch of proteins, I will update this review. I also can't wait to try the yogurt setting as I get tired of spending $$$$ for pre-made yogurt at the store.
I really like the new feature that they added for the quick release. Rather than the round thingy that you had to risk burning yourself with, they have changed it to a switch that is far enough from the release that it would be difficult to burn yourself. They also added a type of diffuser to the release valve to avoid having a ""volcano"" of steam shooting up in the air.
All in all, InstaPot has really thought long and hard about the design of this model! It has many convenient features, intuitive design, and is well constructed. I highly recommend this model. As I mentioned before, I will update this review as I use new features. So far, I'm VERY pleased with my purchase!"
Ector L,"If you have to cook anything in a pot, do it faster and easier with instapots. This one replaced a heavily used older version. Cook anything from frozen to tender in minutes. I put some rice, garlic ginger frozen chicken breasts green onion a splash of soy, sesame oil. Boom dinner in 20 minutes. Just mix it all around and you have a nice Asian inspired chicken and rice dish. Chicken wings. Same thing. From frozen, I cooked them for 15 minutes, let the steam out and fry another 10 minutes to get the skin in crispier state. It’s the best device I have."
ricky martinez,"The Instant Pot Pro is an awesome pressure cooker—really shines there. I haven’t gotten around to testing the other features yet, but I will. This review, though, is about the slow cooker function. I had issues with it stuck on preheat, so I called customer service. They said it can take up to 2 hours to hit the right temp. Three hours in, it’s still on the lowest preheat indicator with two more to go. If you’re hoping for a solid slow cooker combo, I’d pass on this. It just doesn’t cut it for that."
Dorena Mountain Man,"I'm just getting started using my first Insta Pot.
I now have a electric range and I do not like using my old style pressure
cooker on it. The Insta Pot doesn't take up much space and it's so easy to use for so many dishes."
Kenny G,"I was a little skeptical, but it performed better than I expected. In two days, I made brisket in a tomato wine sauce, applesauce, yogurt, carrots cooked with chopped apples and raisins, and a flan. All turned out perfectly in a fraction of the time they usually take. The only downside is that the smell of cooked meat is hard to get out of the machine. I tried soaking the seal in vinegar and water, as recommended, but a faint odor still lingers. I haven't noticed it in the foods I've cooked since though. Highly recommended product."
Hjentzsch93,The cook8ng features on this product are amazing . The food taste great . Functions good and has a huge cooking capacity. Overall best bang for your buck.
Vandos,"It works as a pressure cooker but some of the advertised features don't work. The manual says it can be used for making bread, that's not true. Everytime I try to bake a loaf it errors out and needs to be unplugged. Basically it can only cook things when there's a good amount of liquid in the pan"
DayaS,"There is something wrong with this model , several times we got Burn warning and screen was completely frozen . Only option was to pull plug. We have original model of instant pot which is super old and it even works today without any issue . Only reason we got this one new was for its fancy display and inner pot which has handles . After months of use I can only say it’s good but might not be the best instant pot model."
tarun,"The Instant Pot 10-in-1 has a lot of great features, like the multiple cooking options and the ability to cook meals quickly. It’s easy to use, and the meals turn out tasty most of the time. However, it’s a bit bulky and takes up a lot of counter space. The cooking times can sometimes be inconsistent, and the sealing ring seems to wear out faster than expected. Overall, it’s a solid product but has a few minor issues that could be improved."
Andi C.,"My air fryer is my favorite kitchen appliance, but now my Instant Pot Pro has become a very close second! So easy to cook and steam food in a short amount of time. I bought this to replace my mom’s old crockpot that just wasn’t heating well anymore. Since the Instant Pot Pro can slow cook plus about 9 other things, I thought it was a worthwhile investment. So far, I’ve only used the pressure cook feature to make egg bites and some other steamed veggies (egg bite mold sold separately). The Instant Pot app makes finding other recipes a breeze, and I’m looking forward to making mulled apple cider for Thanksgiving next. So pleased with this purchase!!"
Chef Steve N,"This is My First Instant Pot!
It has handles on the inner pot!!! Those come in real handy lol

I do a lot hybrid cooking from the stove to the pressure to just heat faster But I think this new One heats up just as fast or faster then when I have it on the gas stove lol

My Old Pressure cooker was good to me for the last 4 yrs... but I've out grown it 🥹

I love the handles!!! Make so easy to prep different dishes and to fill up water from the sink for soups and easily carry to the IP. As well as when your done cooking you can easily remove it and carry it when it’s still hot. Even with the insulated silicone handle grips i still use a rag to hold just in case it’s still too hot. Now it’s easily carried and transport to pot lucks with these handles.

In the begging i did have an issue and wanted to return it/replace thinking it was defective but in the end it was a Safe Guard (safety Feature) . I started a cook and walk away for a few mins and when I came back the instant pot was flashing all its display and shut itself down and didn’t work for an hour. So what happen was I trigger the overheat and over pressure safety switch by putting the lid on and locking it instead of just placing it on top in high Sauté mode
So it just got too hot!!! After it cooled back done it began working again… after the lesson learn it never happens again (that because I didn’t make the same mistake again lol) and I’ve use it weekly for the past 5 months. So why replaces it if I know it still work great and the safety of course work too! Maybe my new replacement safety function might not work on that one… in the end I am so happy with my purchase and I’m glad I didn’t return it because of user (me) error
This is a big improvement and upgrade from my off brand presure cooker I had for 4yrs before…

✅Tested pork ribs stew came out perfect! mole and perfect Spanish rice every time 🥰🙌🙏"
fields,"The device itself is a no-brainer. I generally use it for high-pressure cooking for short periods (45 min or less); you can achieve Crock-pot like slow cooking in a tiny fraction of the time. I also love that I can use the pot insert on my gas stovetop, which I do regularly to sear off meats before pressure cooking them in stews. A great dorm tool or bachelor gift for making fast work of one-pot, home-cooked meals. The ""keep Warm"" setting is nice too, to keep a dish warm after cooking.

Yes you can sear in the Instant Pot too using the Saute Setting, but I prefer searing under the vent hood of my stove and not having to get the extension cord on the stove.

Sometimes if the silicone lid gasket isn't seated quite right it won't pressurize, and will continue on the ""warming up"" cycle indefinitely. That means stopping the cook, depressurizing, checking the gasket carefully to reseat it, and trying again. This has happened to me a few times and it's a waste of time, but can't be helped. So I would say gasket design & reliability is in the 90-95% range: not perfect but still very usable.

The gasket does discolor over time (esp from things like oily tomato sauces or tomato paste), and will absorb flavors. To remove odors, check NYT Wirecutter article ""How to Get Smells Out of Silicone Kitchenware"" (YMMV). Pro-tip: for cleaning the stainless pot insert, use Barkeepers Friend and a metal scrubber (like Chore Boy), and it will shine like new."
Bethany Patterson,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she uses it all the time. Her and her boyfriend work odd shifts and eat at odd times and this makes it easy with the pressure cooking to get food done quickly
M Roe,"I am so glad that I bought this Instant Pot Ultra. It is so great at cooking the food and is so fast at cooking the food. If you have not bought one yet, you NEED to"
D. Provenzano,"Loaded with features, options, and controls this cooking device is way more than just a crock pot. slow cook, fast cook, pressure cook, you can just about do it all. I love the heavy-duty inner stainless steel pot for durability. it even comes with a space pressure seal."
R Montgomery,An extremely well-made product which functions as a slow cooker on low or high heat and a pressure cooker with low or high pressure. There are a number of preset functions. A delay start timer is available. Cooking time and temperature or programmable. Keep warm function is also programmable. It took a lot of research to find this but it is exactly what I was looking for.
M. Langholtz,Dump-n-go is frees up hours and $$ weekly
Sadiemitzi,"My second one in a short time, the Max was discontinued and breaking down. Love the handles on the inside pot, saving the ""favorites"" is very helpful to save time, and this pot seems to preheat much faster than the Max, so I have no complaints about it. My brother has the same one so its fun to share recipes and tips."
Jocruz41,"The Instant Pot Pro 10-in-1 Pressure Cooker is an absolute powerhouse in the kitchen! This versatile appliance does it all—whether you're pressure cooking, slow cooking, steaming, sautéing, making yogurt, or even trying sous vide, it handles every task with ease. The 6-quart size is perfect for families, allowing me to prepare anything from quick weeknight dinners to larger meals when entertaining guests.

What sets the Instant Pot Pro apart is the convenience. The controls are intuitive, and the large display makes it easy to switch between functions. It heats up quickly and consistently delivers perfectly cooked meals. The app with over 800 recipes is a fantastic addition, offering endless inspiration and simplifying the cooking process.

The black design is sleek and modern, and I appreciate how compact it is for a multi-function appliance. Cleaning is also a breeze with the stainless steel inner pot and dishwasher-safe components.

Overall, the Instant Pot Pro 10-in-1 has transformed my cooking routine. It's efficient, reliable, and so versatile that I barely need any other kitchen gadgets. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to simplify and elevate their cooking game!"
georgegi,"My wife loves cooking with this. Meats are tender. Rice comes out with a nice texture. We pasteurize eggs with sous vide setting. We use it every day. It gets bonus points for being easy to clean.

Take your time learning how to use it and be careful with the steam from the pressure cooker."
ZK,"I recently purchased the Instant Pot Pro 10-in-1 Pressure Cooker and have been using it for a few weeks now. My primary use has been cooking rice, and I’m pleased to report that it has consistently delivered delicious results. While I initially bought it for rice, I’m excited to explore its versatility. I’ve already started experimenting with dishes like steamed vegetables.

Pros:
he rice cooker excels at cooking rice to perfection. Whether I’m making white, brown, or jasmine rice, it comes out fluffy and evenly cooked. The automatic keep-warm feature ensures that the rice stays at the ideal temperature until I’m ready to serve.

Operating this rice cooker is a breeze. The controls are intuitive, and the one-touch functionality makes it simple to use.

Cons:
The cooker is a bit larger than I anticipated, which can be a challenge if you have limited counter space."
Adirondack J,"Late to the Instant Pot party, but this 6 quart Pro is right sized for our two person household and would comfortably serve a family of four. We love the dishwasher safe lid and built in silicone handles on the pot. So far we have had a quick rotisserie chicken that was very tasty and enough pulled pork for three meals. It's a great addition to the kitchen."
MikeB,Love the internal pot handles and easy cleanup in dishwasher!
Maria C.,"This Instant Pot is one of my favorite appliances! I managed to get it on sale, and I use it frequently. I usually make soups with it, and it makes cooking so much easier, faster, and with less cleanup afterward. It’s a great choice for families with busy schedules!"
Amazon Customer,"Years ago, I bought an insta-pot. It was one of the ones that was recalled. I decided to try the adveristed product. It works well."
Rita L,"I was skeptical about the instant pot until I started using it. It’s incredible. I like to make Thai and Indian dishes. They come out great. I’ve also made a shore dinner and a cheesecake. It’s a learning curve but well worth it. It’s one pot, quick cooking and it’s really good"
Amazon Customer,This is my 3rd pressure cooker and my first Instapot. I have been pressure cooking for years. For some reason when I cook a sausage and rice dish I get mixed results and burning if I don't babysit it. Same amount of ingredients and liquid but 50/50 chance it will burn. It only happens with this one dish so I'm not sure what to think. All other recipes come out perfectly.
monica,Nice work perfectly
CK,"I replaced my 10 year old 6 in 1 Instant Pot with this one on Prime Day. I wasn't expecting much difference and was even a little disappointed that it was all digital, but so far I am very impressed. The saute function is WAY better than the old model and my beef came out perfectly cooked. I've only used it once so far but I look forward to trying my favorite recipes in it."
tw,"Our Bella InstaPot cooker was wearing out so we switched to this newer version of the Instant Pot cooker and really like it. Many improved features make it safer, easier to work with, and easier to clean.
The Instant Pot is our #1 go to appliance for preparing meals, and they always come out cooked to perfection & tasting great."
Razz,"I honestly can't remember how I cooked weekly meals without an Instant Pot. Rice, soup, oatmeal, even roast beef... all better because of IP. Best yet, I use to smoke a pork shoulder for 12-14 hours on my Big Green Egg. Now, I do 4-6 hours to get deep smoke penetration, then I finish the shoulder in my Instant Pot for 90-120 minutes and it is PERFECT. Moist and soft and full of smoke flavor. Can't wait to explore more recipes."
Potrzebie,"The product arrived with all its pieces and parts and in perfect working order. The manufacturer's recommend test run was flawless. Cooking actual food, using several of the different functions yielded wonderful results. So far, the Instant Pot performs exactly as advertised."
